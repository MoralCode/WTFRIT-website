# WTFRIT website

This is the primary frontend for the WTFRIT frontend. Created as a [BrickHack9 project](https://brickhack9.devpost.com), the purpose of this site is to show a summary of the various issues affecting RIT students as aggregated and analyzed based on various publicly-available sources, such as (some of these may be coming soon):
 - Reddit
 - PawPrints
 - Reporter Magazine


The ultimate goal is to create a one-stop place for interested people in the RIT community to quickly see what students are talking about at-a-glance. 


## Running Locally
This is a Jekyll site, so `bundle exec jekyll serve` should help. If dependencies and things are a problem, a docker image for locally hosting the site may be a useful way to set something up that "Just works".
